**Q. What is fibonacci series**
A series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers is called as the Fibonacci Series.

The Fibonacci numbers can easily obtained by using the following formula:

  Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 
where

Tn = current term.
Tn-1 = preceeding term.
Tn-2 = second preceeding term.
This gives us the following sequence that goes to infinity:

    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....


q. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.



Sample Test Case
Input : Edyoda
output: adoydE


**Ans
Reverse String using Slicing**

To reverse a string in Python, we will use slicing. Specifically, we will use [::-1]. Here we have not provided the start and end, therefore slicing would happen from start to end of the string. -1 would make the slicing happen in reverse, i.e., from end to start. And str[::-1] would result in a reversed string.

**** Reverse String using For Loop** 
we will reverse a string using Python For Loop. With for loop, we iterate over characters in string and append each character at the front of a new string(initially empty). By the end of the for loop, we should have a reversed string.

**Q. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.**


Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 

Expected Output :

Number of even numbers : 5

Number of odd numbers : 4
**Ans**
